# SoccerBet

The app that

- serves info about upcoming soccer matches of different leagues or tournaments, current league standings, stats of finished matches, and bets for each match.

- simulates the platform where users can bet on games, experience winning or losing, and communicate with each other on any team about anything through comment sections.

Leagues and tournaments that it currently covers:

- **Champions League (UCL)**
- **Premiere League (EPL)**
- **La Liga (LAL)**
- **Bundesliga (BUN)**

Bigger tournaments such as **FIFA World Cup, UEFA EURO, or Copa America** are seasonal and will be covered when the time comes. More leagues can also be covered in the future.

## Improvement in the future 
Some improvements that I'm actively working on: 
- Form validation
- Persistence of the bet cart across pages 
- Better design in general 

It's also a possibility that I will replace CSS code with TailwindCSS.
